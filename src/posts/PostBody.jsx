        Grateful for the incredible experience of serving as the President of
        the Grand Jury board for this year's Digital Marketing Award organized
        by Bangladesh Brand Forum. Judging the best digital marketing campaigns
        was not just a responsibility but a journey of appreciation for
        innovation and creativity. The judging process, ensuring transparency,
        brought to light so many beautiful campaigns. Cheers to the dynamic
